## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS - Flexbox

via VSC


### What I learned

 - Use of media query and responsiveness
 - organize my work for a responsive design and make a clearer code. 
 - the different mesure units (vh, em, rem) // didn't used them a lot but i've done search on them and there uses. 
 - max-heigth/ min-with and vice-versa.
 - understand better the flex system


### Continued development

- Organisation. I think i made it upside down, i should have start with the easiest layout (the phone) and add more complixity (the bigger screen size).
- use more flexible mesure units.
